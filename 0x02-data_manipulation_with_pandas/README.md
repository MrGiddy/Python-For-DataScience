## 1. Creating DataFrames
### Problem: Contact List(Locating Contacts)
- You are given a dictionary that contains names and numbers of people.
- You need to create a DataFrame from the dictionary and add an index to it, which should be the name values.
- Then take a name from user input and output the row in the DataFrame, which corresponds to that row.

## 2. Indexing & Slicing
### Problem: Numbers and Ranks(Ranking Board)
- You are given a DataFrame that includes the names and ranks of people
- You need to take a rank as input and output the corresponding column from the DataFrame as a Series
- Note that the rank is an integer, so you need to convert the user input to an integer

## 3. Reading Data
- You are working with 'ca-covid' CSV file that contains the COVID-19 infection data in California for the year 2020
- The file provides data on daily cases and deaths for the entire year
- Find and output the row that corresponds to December 31, 2020
